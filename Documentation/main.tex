	\section{Overview}

	VShooter is a singleplayer top-down roguelite arcade-style shooter inspired by games such as Into the Dead and Soul Knight. Vshooter blends modern VTuber craze and classic gameplay, aiming for a PG-13 audience and a Windows platform backed by the Unity engine.

  	\section{Gameplay}

	VShooter's gameplay is intuitive. Players select from a pool of VTubers at the start of the game. With their VTuber of choice, players shoot at enemies on a stage. Enemies behave in a variety of ways. They may rush at the player. They may also shoot at the player or exhibit other behaviors. Enemies become progressively more challenging as the player progresses through stages. To offset the increase in difficulty, the player's VTuber maintains an experience bar and gains levels. Experience is gained when an enemy is detroyed. Levels are gained after sufficient experience. Upon gaining a level, the player may select an upgrade for their VTuber, conferring additional properties to the VTuber. VTuber upgrades carry over across stages, but reset upon defeat. Each stage features a boss that the player has to defeat to progress to the next stage.

	\section{Controls}

	Players control their VTuber by using the WASD keys.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item W: Move forward by a limited amount.
		\item A: Move backward by a limited amount.
		\item S: Move to the left until the boundaries of the stage.
		\item D: Move to the right until the boundaries of the stage.
	\end{itemize}

	Additionally, players may also use the following controls to perform special actions.

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Q: Activate their VTuber's first Active Skill.
		\item E: Activate their VTuber's second Active Skill.
		\item Left Mouse Click: Rotate their Vtuber to the left around the y-axis.
		\item Right Mouse Click: Rotate their Vtuber to the right around the y-axis.
	\end{itemize}

	Through these controls, the player must overcome hordes of various enemies.

	\section{VTuber Selection}

	At the start of the game, the player is taken to the VTuber selection screen. They may select a VTuber that they'll control in the game. The VTuber selection screen displays a description of each VTuber available, allowing the player to make an informed decision according to their preferences.
  	
  	\subsection{Stats} \label{Player Stats}
  	
  	All VTubers have a defined set of base stats. For more information on the base stats of each VTuber, please refer to section \ref{VTubers}.
  	
  	\subsubsection{Primary Stats}

  	\begin{itemize}
  	\item \textbf{Health.} The lose condition of the player controlling the VTuber. Health is lost upon collision with enemies or enemy projectiles, or scripted in-game events. If the VTuber's health drops to 0, they lose the game. Lost health may be regained via several types of upgrades (e.g. \textit{lifesteal}, \textit{health regen}, etc.). A VTuber's maximum health may also be increased through upgrades.

  	\item \textbf{Experience.} Defeating an enemy grants experience according to its type. For specifics, please refer to section \ref{Enemies}. 
  	
  	\item \textbf{Level.} If the VTuber gains a set amount of experience, they gain a level. The experience required for gaining a level is calculated using the following formula:
  	
  	\[E(L) = 2.5L^2 + 32.5L + 40\]
  	
  	where $L$ is the next level of the VTuber and $E(L)$ is the total experience required to reach the next level.
  	
  	Each additional level requires more experience to be gained. Gaining a level allows the player to select an upgrade from a randomly selected pool. For more information on upgrades, please refer to section \ref{Upgrades}.
  	
  	\item \textbf{Attack.} Increases the damage dealt by the VTuber's projectiles. Attack may be increased through upgrades.

  	\item\textbf{Defense.} Reduces the total damage received by the VTuber. Additional defense may be gained through upgrades. Defense has reduced effectiveness at higher values. The total damage reduced by defense is calculated using the following formula:
  	
  	\[P_1(x) = P_0(x) \times \frac{100}{100+D}\]
  	
  	where $P_0(x)$ is the pre-mitigation damage, $D$ is the defense of the VTuber, and $P_1(x)$ is the post mitigation damage.
  	
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  	\subsubsection{Secondary Stats}
  	
  	\begin{itemize}
  	 \item \textbf{Crit Rate and Crit Damage.} Projectile attacks have a chance to deal increased damage to enemies. The chance for a projectile to deal critical damage is determined by the VTuber's \textit{Crit Rate}. The critical damage is determined by the VTuber's \textit{Crit Damage}. All VTubers begin with 0\% Crit Rate and 150\% Crit Damage. Crit Rate and Crit Damage may be increased through upgrades. The total damage is given by the following formula:

  	 \[
	  	 P_0(x) = Rand\begin{cases}
	  	 	R(x) & 1 - C_R\\
	  	 	R(x) \times C_D & C_R \\
	  	 \end{cases}
  	 \]
  	 
  	 where $R(x)$ is the raw damage from the source, $C_R$ is the Crit Rate of the player, $C_D$ is the Crit Damage of the player, and $P_0(x)$ is the (pre-mitigated) damage.
  	 
  	\end{itemize}
  	
  	\subsection{Upgrades} \label{Upgrades}
  	
  	When a VTuber levels up, they are able to select an upgrade drawn from a randomly selected pool of \textit{equipment} and three (3) unique \textit{Character Passives}. \\
  	
  	If the player already has the upgrade and draws the same upgrade from the random pool, they instead level up that upgrade to increase its effects. \textit{Equipment} can be upgraded up to five (5) times and \textit{Character Passives} can be upgraded up to three (3) times. For more information on each Vtuber's Character Passives, please refer to section \ref{VTubers}.
	
  	\subsubsection{Equipment}
  	
  	\textit{Equipment} are upgrades that are available for all VTubers. Common Equipment may be upgraded up to five (5) times.

Buff Ame's special attack spawns a number of missiles that home in toward the player's VTuber. Each missile deals a small amount of damage.
