<i>Can you survive? Battle and fight a swarm of enemies to save HoloWorld!</i> ‚ú®

Build and upgrade your perfect character in this rogue-like arcade shooter featuring different virtual youtubers and content creators. [^note] **VShooter** features three stages, all with different bosses, enemies, and environments, custom upgrades such as attack speed, crit chance, and ability cooldown reduction, and custom characters with their own unique passive and active abilities. This personal project was done with a team of passionate game developers from the University of the Philippines Visayas, written in C# and Unity as a partial requirement for passing the Game Development elective course of the academe.

## **Installation Instructions**

Download the preferred version in the releases section of this repository. Extract the ZIP folder and launch the game.

## **How to Play**

- **üêà‚Äç‚¨õ Select a Character:** Each character has a set of three exclusive passives that can be obtained through upgrades and a set of two castable active abilities with different cooldowns and effects. Select the character that best fits your playstyle or try them all out!
  - For example, Mori Calliope specializes on granting bonus effects while killing enemies and focuses on expending health and restoring health as a secondary resource.
- **üî´ Shoot Enemies:** Killing enemies grants experience points. Earning enough experience earns you a level. Each level up allows the user to select an upgrade from a random pool.
- **üíÄ Boss Timer:** Each stage has a boss that spawns after surviving for a certain time. Try to level up as quick as possible to maximize your upgrades to be able to defeat the boss! Defeating the stage boss promotes you to the next stage with a higher difficulty while also keeping the upgrades you got from the previous stage. Complete all stages to win the game!
